How to use the batch mode from cado-nfs.py
==========================================

We take as example the factorization of the 59-digit number in cado-nfs/README.

The first usage is very simple:

$ ./cado-nfs.py 90377629292003121684002147101760858109247336549001090677693 tasks.sieve.batch=true

but in this way, the batch files are generated once again for each sieving job.
To precompute them once for all, do the following:

1) you first need to generate a polynomial for your number, say c60.poly

2) then run with the lim0, lim1 parameters from params.c60, and
   batchlpb0 = lpb0, batchlpb1 = lpb1:

$ ./build/sieve/ecm/precompbatch -poly /tmp/c60.poly -lim0 78682 -lim1 111342 -batchlpb0 18 -batchlpb1 19 -batch0 /tmp/batch0 -batch1 /tmp/batch1

3) then run:

$ ./cado-nfs.py 90377629292003121684002147101760858109247336549001090677693 tasks.sieve.batch=true tasks.sieve.batch0=/tmp/batch0 tasks.sieve.batch1=/tmp/batch1
