duplicates -nrels <n> <rel_file>  >  <rel_file2>
  Remove duplicates. The output format is the same as the input format
  for relations.

purge -poly <poly_file> -nrels <n> <rel_file>  >  <purged_file>
  Remove singletons. The format of the purged file is as follows:
     nrows ncols
     index_in_rel_file nb_of_entries ncol_1 ncol_2 ...
     index_in_rel_file nb_of_entries ncol_1 ncol_2 ...
     ...

merge -prune <p> -merge <m> -mat <purged_file> -maxlevel <l> -cwmax <c> -rwmax <r> [-v] > <history_file>
  Perform the merging. Keep the info in the history file, that contains on each
  line the indices of two rows to be added.

replay <purged_file> <history_file> <small_matrix_file> <index_file> [-v]
  Replays the history given by merge in order to produce a sparse matrix. The
  correspondance with the initial data is kept in index_file.
  The format of the sparse matrix is:
    nrows ncols
    nb_entries ncol_1 ncol_2 ...
    nb_entries ncol_1 ncol_2 ...
    nb_entries ncol_1 ncol_2 ...
    ...
  The format of the index file is:
    nrows ncols    ## same as in sparse matrix
    nb_of_ab_pairs index_in_rel_file_1 index_in_rel_file_2 ...
    nb_of_ab_pairs index_in_rel_file_1 index_in_rel_file_2 ...
    ...
  The lines of sparse matrix and index files are in correspondance.

linalg <small_matrix_file> <ker_file>
  Produces vectors in the the kernel of the matrix.

characters / allsqrt : do not really belong to linalg subdir, and will change
anyway, so we don't explain more.
