Here are the useful macros that are defined by macros.h and their
semantics:

ASSERT(x)
        The condition x is checked unless NDEBUG is defined, just like
        the standard assert() in assert.h .
ASSERT_ALWAYS(x)
        The condition x is always checked, whatever you define. In case
        of failure, it aborts, and gives the line, function, and so on
        information.
FATAL_ERROR_CHECK(x, msg)
        The condition x is always check. The program aborts if it does
        not hold. It's a more gentle version of ASSERT_ALWAYS
DIE_ERRNO_DIAG(tst, func, arg)
        This is yet another version, specific to system calls: tst is a
        boolean that indicates if the call failed. func and arg are
        strings giving the function call name and its arguments.

Usage of asserts:
        Put ASSERTs to checks things during a non-production mode. These
        should not be too expensive, so that in development mode they can
        be activated without the code being too slow to be executed on
        typical data.
        If in your code you need to do some computations before checking
        the condition, you can encapsulate this code in #ifndef NDEBUG
        ... #endif
        WARNING: the use of WANT_ASSERT is deprecated!

        You are of course allowed to add your own additional assert
        variants in a specific file, (like ASSERT_EXPENSIVE), but they
        should not go to macros.h.


ABS(x)
MIN(x,y)
MAX(x,y)
        As usual. Please don't redefine your own.


MAYBE_UNUSED
        This corresponds to gcc's unused attribute. Probably other
        compilers also have it, but for the moment, this works only for
        gcc.
        The goal is to tag some function or some parameter to be possibly
        unused, in order to avoid the corresponding warning at compile
        time (-W -Wall). Here is an example:
                int first_arg(int x, int y MAYBE_UNUSED) {
                #ifndef NDEBUG
                        fprintf(stderr, "entering first_arg(%d,%d)\n", x, y);
                #endif
                        return x;
                }
        When compiled with #define NDEBUG, the compiler would complain
        without y tagged MAYBE_UNUSED.
        The same macro can be used for a variable:
            int n MAYBE_UNUSED;
        or for a static function:
            MAYBE_UNUSED static inline void foo() { print("Foo\n"); }
        Note that MAYBE_UNUSED, as described here, can be used only for
        gcc 3.4 and later. Earlier versions (3.1 to 3.3) did have the
        unused attribute, but the rules for the placement of the
        attribute were different. For the record:
            int first_arg(int x, int MAYBE_UNUSED y) { blah blah }
        and, for a function, in two steps:
            static inline void foo() MAYBE_UNUSED;
            static inline void foo() { blah blah }

LIKELY(x)
UNLIKELY(x)
        These correspond to gcc's __builtin_expect() function.
        In a critical loop, if you have a conditional for which there is
        a big bias, you can tell the compiler which branch is likely. The
        compiler will try to pass this information to the processor
        (usually, a proc assumes that a backward jump is likely, and a
        forward jump is unlikely).
        In practice, do as in this example:
                while (!finished()) {
                        x = get_next_data();
                        if (LIKELY(x != 0))
                                deal_with_data(x);
                        else
                                special_case();
                }
        Don't use it for non-critical parts of the code. It does not hurt
        the compiler, but still can make it harder for a human to read
        the code.


GNUC_VERSION(x,y,z)
        Enables a given block only for version x.y.z of the GNU C Compiler
GNUC_VERSION_ATLEAST(x,y,z)
GNUC_VERSION_ATMOST(x,y,z)
        Same for version >= x.y.z, or <= x.y.z
