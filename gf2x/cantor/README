This package provides an implementation of Cantor's algorithm for
multiplying two binary polynomials using "additive FFT".

The exported function are:

void mulCantor128(unsigned long *H, unsigned long *F, int Fl, unsigned long *G, int Gl);

	multiplies two polynomials F(x) and G(x) and put the results in
	H(x).  F(x) is represented in a dense way by an array F of Fl
	blocks of w bits (where w is the bit width of unsigned long), the
	same for G, with Gl blocks, and the result is put in the table H,
	that must have room for Fl+Gl blocks of w bits.

as well as other functions allowing FFT caching.

extern void c128_setup(c128_info_t p, int dF, int dG);

	sets up the appropriate data for multiplying polynomials having
	degrees bounded respectively by dF and dG.
	
extern c128_t c128_alloc(const c128_info_t p, int n);

	allocates space for n transforms.

extern void c128_free(const c128_info_t p, c128_t x, int n); 

	frees the n transforms allocated at x

extern void c128_zero(const c128_info_t p, c128_t x, int n); 

	initialize to zero the n transforms allocated at x

extern inline c128_get(const c128_info_t p, c128_t x, int k); 

	accesses the k-th transform stored at location x.

extern void c128_dft(const c128_info_t p, c128_t x, unsigned long * F, int dF);

	performs a direct transform of F, having degree at most dF.

extern void c128_compose(const c128_info_t p,
		c128_t y, c128_src_t x1, c128_src_t x2);

	composes the transforms of two polynomials. The result is by
	definition the transform of their product.

extern void c128_add(const c128_info_t p,
		c128_t y, c128_src_t x1, c128_src_t x2);

	adds two transforms (the direct transform is linear).

extern void c128_ift(const c128_info_t p, unsigned long * H, int dH, c128_t h);

	performs an inverse transform.


This package relies on some routines taken from the Mpfq library. This
should work (?) on any x86 computer with SSE2 instruction set. The GMP
library must be installed.

To compile it, adjust the FLAGS variable in the Makefile, and type

make all

This should produce 3 binaries:
  - bench
  - cantor

bench measures the time spent to multiply two polynomials (type ./bench
for usage).  cantor is a small utility that takes two random polynomials,
multiply them and print the corresponding data, for testing purpose. It
is used by the script check_cantor that will checked the result against
Magma (assuming it is installed).

Examples:

./bench 64 1000 -f 1.1
