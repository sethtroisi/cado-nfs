/*
 * As for ``ifft_radix2`` except that the output is assumed to have
 * zeros from coefficient trunc onwards and only the first trunc
 * coefficients of the input are specified. The remaining coefficients need
 * to exist as the extra space is needed, but their value is irrelevant.
 * The value of ``trunc`` must be divisible by 2.
 * 
 * Although the implementation does not require it, we assume for simplicity
 * that ``trunc`` is greater than `n`. The algorithm begins by computing
 * the inverse transform of the first `n` coefficients of the input array.
 * The unspecified coefficients of the second half of the array are then
 * written: coefficient ``trunc + i`` is computed as a twist of
 * coefficient ``i`` by a root of unity. The values of these coefficients
 * are then equal to what they would have been if the inverse transform of
 * the right hand side of the input array had been computed with full data
 * from the start. The function ``ifft_truncate1`` is then called on the
 * entire right half of the input array with this auxilliary data filled in.
 * Finally a single layer of the IFFT is completed on all the coefficients
 * up to ``trunc`` being careful to note that this involves doubling the
 * coefficients from ``trunc - n`` up to ``n``.
