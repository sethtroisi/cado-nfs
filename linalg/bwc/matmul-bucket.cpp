/* {{{ Documentation

 * Parameters referred to by this documentation text may be tuned via
 * #define's below.
 *
 * This implementation builds upon the ``sliced'' variant. 
 * The format used with the -sliced implementation is still used, but
 * there is also another format used for very dense strips. We refer to
 * matmul-sliced.cpp for the first format, which is called ``small1''
 * here (and there also).
 *
 * The ``small2'' format is specialised for denser strips.  Within an
 * horizontal strip of less than 4096 rows, when two non-zero columns are
 * never more than 16 positions apart, then the information (dj,i) is
 * stored in 16 bits instead of 32. This reduces the memory footprint
 * quite considerably, since many coefficients are in dense strips.
 * Speed-wise, small2 strips provide a nice speed-up sometimes (not
 * always).
 *
 * When we reach sparser areas, we use another method. Dense (small2 and
 * small1) slices having been discarded, the rest is split in ``large''
 * slices of LSL_NBUCKETS_MAX*256 rows at most (in fact we arrange for the
 * slices to have equal size, so it's a bit less).  For each such large
 * slice, we use scratch space equal to the L2 cache size for performing
 * matrix multiplication. While reading column vector data, we copy
 * coefficient to (up to) LSL_NBUCKETS_MAX ``buckets'', each representing
 * 256 possible row indices. The dispatching information, telling in
 * which bucket a given coefficient has to be copied, is an 8-bit integer
 * stored in a table called ``main''. Each entry in table ``main'' also
 * has a second 8-bit integer indicating the offset to the next useful
 * column entry (because we're considering very sparse blocks, it is not
 * at all uncommon to see average values ~ 10 here, even when
 * LSL_NBUCKETS_MAX==256, so that 65536 rows are considered
 * simultaneously).
 *
 * The number of columns considered while filling the scratch space is
 * limited by the scratch space size. Once it's filled, we ``apply the
 * buckets'', so as to be able to reuse our scratch space buffer for
 * another batch of columns. Thus a ``large slice'' is typically split
 * into several ``vertical blocks''. Extremely sparse large slices will
 * have only one vertical block.
 *
 * ``Applying the buckets'' means taking a list of column coefficients
 * which have been directed to the bucket because it is known that they
 * affect at least one of the 256 corresponding row indices on output. So
 * in addition to the N coefficients stored in the bucket, we have a
 * list of N 8-bit integers indicating which row index is to be modified.
 *
 * [the section below is superseded by the next one]
 * That's it for the basic idea. Now on top of that, we use an extra
 * indirection level for very sparse blocks. Several ``large blocks'' are
 * considered together as part of a ``huge block''. Call this number
 * ``nlarge''. Source coefficients are first dispatched in nlarge ``big
 * buckets'' of appropriate size. The number of columns considered is
 * guided by the fact that we want none of these big buckets to exceed
 * the L2 cache size.  Afterwards, we do a second bispatching from each
 * of these big buckets (in turn) to (up to) LSL_NBUCKETS_MAX small
 * buckets in the same manner as above (except that we no longer need the
 * information on the link to the next useful column.
 *
 * [documentation of the new format]
 * After ``large'' blocks, we consider ``deferred'' blocks, also referred
 * to as (vertical) staircase-shaped blocks. The idea is the following.
 * The portion of the matrix under study is split into several vertical
 * blocks of at most 2^16 entries. In the other direction, we make splits
 * according to the average row density. A first batch of row has some
 * indicative density X, the next one X/2, and so on (the ratio 2 being
 * in fact VSC_BLOCKS_FLUSHFREQ_RATIO) until the sparsest block at the
 * bottom.  Such horizontal blocks need not have the same size. 
 *
 * Vertical strips are processed in order. Buffers corresponding to the
 * sub-matrices in the different sub-matrices created by the horizontal
 * splitting are filled. We thus populate scratch space with coefficients
 * from the source vector. After each such processing of a vertical
 * strip, we consider whether we have to perform flushing w.r.t. the
 * horizontal strips. The buffers corresponding to the densest horizontal
 * strip are flushed after each vstrip processing. Those which are twice
 * sparser are flushed twice less often. Thus the next vstrip occupies
 * some more buffer space. This pattern goes until the sparsest block,
 * which is probably flushed only once. The total amount of buffer space
 * needed is proportional to the number of coefficients in an area having
 * a staircase shape. Assume we have N vstrips of width W. Assume
 * horizontal blocks have a number of rows R0, R1, R2, ... corresponding
 * to densities X, X/2, X/4, ...  (the ratio 2 here is in fact given by
 * VSC_BLOCKS_FLUSHFREQ_RATIO). The formula
 * for the tbuf space is:
 *   max weight of the N matrices of size R0*W in h. strip #0
 * + max weight of the N/2 matrices of size R1*2W in h. strip #1
 * + max weight of the N/4 matrices of size R2*4W in h. strip #2
 * ...
 * It should be noted that the numbers added up in this formula are
 * expected to be of the same magnitude asymptotically. For real-life
 * examples though, it's pretty common to observe somewhat degenerate
 * cases.
