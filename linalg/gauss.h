/* Compute the right nullspace of the nrows times ncols matrix given by

 * of arrays given by the ker argument, where each member is expected to
 * hold space for at least limbs_per_col mp_limb_t values. Caution leads
 * to allocate as many as ncols pointers in the ker array.
 *
 * The dimension of the kernel is given by the return value. If ker ==
 * NULL, this is the only thing computed (and limbs_per_col is unused).

 * limbs_per_row (and accordingly limbs_per_col) must of course being
 * larger than or equal to ceiling(nrows/GMP_LIMB_BITS). We allow this
 * value to be exceeded so as to allow some padding.
 *
 * In case you wonder, this function is not reentrant at all. Sorry.
