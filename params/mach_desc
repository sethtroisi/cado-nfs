# Machine description file.
#
# This file is split into several sections [cluster_name].
# The sections are independent.
# The binaries for the master computer (the one running cadofactor) are
# searched in the first section.
#
# Each section is read in order.
# Leading white space is not significant.
# Lines starting with ``something='' affect the variable ``something''.
# Lines starting with a word without ``='' denote a machine name.
# A machine name may be followed by variable assignments which are specific to
# the machine.
#
# Some info on accepted variables:
# ================================
#
# tmpdir and bindir are mandatory:
#     tmpdir = directory containing the relations during the calculation
#              on a machine.
#     bindir = directory containing the binary files on a machine.
# cores is the number of cores used on a machine for the sieve (default is 1).
#     For example: if cores=5 and $param{'sieve_max_threads'}=2 then 3 jobs
#     will be run on the machine (2+2+1).
# poly_cores (optional) is the number of cores used on a machine for the
#     polynomial selection (default is the value of "cores").
# mpi=1 (optional) after machine name for using MPI in linear algebra on this
#     machine, default mpi=0. If mpi=0 for all machines, then the linear
#     algebra will be run on localhost.
#     To use MPI, CADO-NFS must be compiled with a MPI library, check that
#     the path of the MPI library is in the file local.sh (for example:
#     MPI=/usr/lib64/openmpi).
#
#
# Changing the list during a computation:
# =======================================
#
# The mach_desc file is read once and for all by cadofactor.pl at the very
# beginning. However, cadofactor.pl is (supposed to be) robust to being killed
# and restarted. So to force a modification in mach_desc to be taken into
# account, you just have to kill and restart cadofactor.pl.
#
# Here is a rough description of the expected behaviour when you change
# mach_desc.
#
# If during a computation you want to add a machine, you just have to add
# an appropriate line.  You can also increase the number of cores of an
# already listed machine. Such changes require cadofactor.pl to be interrupted
# and re-run (which resumes the computation from where it has been left off).
#
# If you need to stop the jobs on a machine, you can put cores=0 after its
# name. Once the current job is finished on the machine, no new job will be
# started again. Do not remove the machine name of the list, otherwise
# cadofactor.pl won't know where to look for tmp data to import result.
# If you cannot wait for the job to be finished, feel free to kill it after
# having put cores=0 in this file: cadofactor.pl will eventually detect that
# the job is dead and import the partial result file.
#
# When you decrease the value of cores, this will have a similar effect: the
# script will let the job finish but won't start new ones until the number of 
# jobs becomes less than the value of cores.
#
# If you need to change tmpdir or bindir during a computation, this is
# more tricky, since cadofactor.pl assumes that all the jobs on a machine
# run with the same tmpdir. Therefore, you have do it like so:
#  - put cores=0 for the target machine
#  - restart cadofactor.pl
#  - wait until all running jobs of the machine are finished
#  - change tmpdir / bindir for this machine
#  - put the previous value of cores.
#  - restart cadofactor.pl
#
