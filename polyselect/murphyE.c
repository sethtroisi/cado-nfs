/* Murphy's E-value is defined on pages 86 and 87 of Murphy's thesis:

   E(f,g) = sum(rho(u_f(theta_i))*rho(u_g(theta_i)), i=1..K)
   
   where theta_i = Pi/K*(i-1/2)

   and u_f(theta_i) = (log(|F(cos(theta_i)*s^(1/2),sin(theta_i)/s^(1/2))|)
                       + alpha_f)/log(B_f)

   where s is the skewness, F(x,y) is the bivariate polynomial associated to f,
   alpha_f is the alpha-value for f, B_f is the smoothness bound associated
   to f (idem for g).

   This bound depends on the smoothness bounds B_f and B_g.

   In his pol51opt code, Kleinjung uses B_f = 1e7 and B_g = 5e6.
   He also scales x=cos(theta_i)*s^(1/2) and y=sin(theta_i)/s^(1/2) by
   a factor sqrt(area), with area = 1e16.
