        # the second child, in the orphaned group will be sent a SIGHUP.
        #
        # "However, as part of the session management system, there are exactly
        # two cases where SIGHUP is sent on the death of a process:
        #
        #   1) When the process that dies is the session leader of a session
        #      that is attached to a terminal device, SIGHUP is sent to all
        #      processes in the foreground process group of that terminal
        #      device.
        #   2) When the death of a process causes a process group to become
        #      orphaned, and one or more processes in the orphaned group are
        #      stopped, then SIGHUP and SIGCONT are sent to all members of the
        #      orphaned group." [2]

        # have a controlling terminal.  The second case isn't so easy to
        # dismiss.
        # The process group is orphaned when the first child terminates and
        # POSIX.1 requires that every STOPPED process in an orphaned process
        # group be sent a SIGHUP signal followed by a SIGCONT signal.  Since the
