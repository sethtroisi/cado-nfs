/*

We want a function that checks whether a relation is, with high probability, 
a duplicate of an earlier relation. 

"Earlier" requires that we define some ordering on relations. Note that we may
sieve special-q on both sides for some factorisations, in particular SNFS.
It is possible that the same prime occurs on both sides if it divides the 
two polynomials' resultant, which likewise may occur for SNFS.

We define the sieving order as sieving special-q on the algebraic side of 
norm n if n is in the special-q range for the algebraic side, 
then on the rational side of norm n if n is in the special-q range for the 
rational side, then increasing n by 1.

Let Q_0 be the primes in the special-q range on the algebraic side, 
and Q_1 on the rational side. If we sieve only one side i \in {0,1}, 
then the set Q_{1-i} is empty.

When we sieve special-q on only one side i, a relation is "earlier" 
simply if it contains a prime on side i that is in Q_i and smaller than 
the current q. (1)

If we sieve both sides, a relation is earlier if
- (1) holds, or
- we sieve q on the algebraic side and it contains a prime q' on the rational 
  side in Q_1 less than q
- we sieve q on the rational side and it contains a prime q' on the algebraic 
  side in Q_0 less than or equal to q

NOTE: this strategy for the case where we sieve two sides is not implemented.
Currently, las has no way to know about it.

Then we must go through the various steps the siever does to identify 
relations and check the conditions that cause the relation to be found or 
missed.

The relation is a dupe if:
- It may have been found by an "earlier" special-q $q'$
- The relation must be in the I,J sieving area that was used when sieving in 
  the $q'$-lattice
- The estimated norm, minus the log of the FB primes, is within the report 
  threshold. This is tricky, as there are many shortcuts to norm estimation,
  and the contribution of FB primes depends on the choice of log scale and 
  on limits on prime powers that are sieved
- The cofactors of the two norms, without q' but with q on the special-q side, 
  are within the cofactor bounds mfb[ar]
- The cofactors on both sides can be factored by the cofactorization routines 
  that were used when sieving q'.

Thus the function to check for duplicates needs the following information:

- The relation with fully factored norms
- The special-q sieve range on the two sides
- For each q' that was sieved "earlier"
  - The parameters used for generating the special-q' lattice (skewness)
  - The I,J values
  - The log scale
  - The cofactor bounds mfb[ar]
  - The cofactorization parameters
