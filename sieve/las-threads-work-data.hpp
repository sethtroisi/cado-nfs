/*
 * This structure holds the key algorithmic data that is used in las. It
 * is intentionally detached from the rest of the ``stats-like'' control
 * data (found in nfs_aux, defined in las-auxiliary-data.hpp)
 *
 * This is really sort of a "work space", with allocated buckets, bucket
 * regions, and so on.
 *
 * Two important aspects here:
 *
 *  - Everything here is attached to one special-q only. Concurrent
 *    access for various special-q's is not possible.
 *  - Allocated space for one structure may be reused for another
 *    special-q.
 *
 * We have here nb_threads threads that will work with nb_threads+1 (or 1
 * if nb_threads==1 anyway) reservation_arrays in each data member of the
 * two reservation_groups in the groups[] data member. This +1 is here to
 * allow work to spread somewhat more evenly.
 *
 * Thread-private memory areas such as bucket regions are allocated in
 * the thread_data fields.
