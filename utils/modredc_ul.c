/* If the inverse exists, the value of t is bounded below by log_2(y+x) - 1.
   Proof.
   
   Assume y is odd, gcd(y, x) = 1.
   
            { 0, y = x (implies y = x = 1)
   t(y,x) = { t(y, x/2)+1, y != x, x even
            { t(x, y), y > x, x odd
            { t(y, x-y) , y < x, x odd
            
   The last case implies y != x-y and x-y even, so can be substituted by
              t(y, (x-y)/2) + 1 , y < x, x odd
   In case 2, y+x  ->  y + x/2 and y + x/2 >= (y+x)/2.
   In case 4, y+x  ->  y + (x-y)/2 and y + (x-y)/2 = (y+x)/2.
   So each time t increases by 1, y+x drops by at most half. The process 
   stops when y = x = 1, i.e. y+x = 2. Hence, t >= log_2(y+x) - 1.

   Before the correction step, the result is 2^t/a, 
   where t >= log_2(y+x)-1. We divide here by 2^(w-ceil(log_2(y+x)-1))
   and init t = -ceil(log_2(y+x)-1), so that the result before the
   correction step is 2^(w+t)/a with t >= 0. This way we can do the 
   correction step via a single REDC of width t. */
