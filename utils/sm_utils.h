/* Which SMs are used ?
 * There have been several choices during time. We keep track of the old
 * choices, in case there are still parts of the code that make reference
 * to them.
 *
 * Normally, for compatibility with previous data files, we strive to
 * provide access to the old computation conventions. Be aware, however,
 * that this is inherently fragile, and not always tested. The chosen SM
 * mode must be consistent throughout the computation.
 *
 * Legacy choice (internal name SM_MODE_LEGACY_PRE2018, argument
 * --sm-mode legacy)
 *
 *   Compute modulo f(x), with an exponent corresponding to the LCM of
 *   all factors modulo ell. Then take the coefficients of the resulting
 *   polynomials, starting with the one with largest degree, in order to
 *   avoid jokes with the constant coefficient and Galois effects.
 *
 * Transitional: (same)
 *   Do this computation using CRT modulo all factors of f(x), but
 *   keeping the compatibility with the legacy choice.
 *
 * Choice activated in ec940b55a (summer 2018); (internal name
 * SM_MODE_2018, argument --sm-mode 2018. This is also the current
 * default, so that --sm-mode default is an alias to this)
 *   Select a subset of factors of f(x) mod ell so that their degrees sum
 *   up to (just) at least the number of required SMs. See
 *   sm_side_info_init() for the basic algorithm that chooses these
 *   factors.
 *   Then compute modulo each factor f_i(x) mod ell, with the exponent
 *   attached to the degree of this factor. Each coefficient of the
 *   resulting polynomial, taken in increasing degree order, contributes
 *   to a list of deg(f_1)+...+deg(f_k) coordinates. The nsm furst
 *   coordinates of this list are elected as the SM vector.
 *
 * Alternate mode, maybe better (internal name SM_MODE_2019REV, argument
 * --sm-mode 2019rev)
 *   This is almost the same as the previous one, except that the list of
 *   deg(f_1)+...+deg(f_k) coordinates is built by taking the
 *   coefficients of each of the components in reverse degree order.
 *
 * Potential future extension (internal name
 * SM_MODE_PSEUDORANDOM_COMBINATION, argument --sm-mode pseudorandom).
 *   We might consider implementing some sort of pseudo-random
 *   combination of the coefficients. The exact details are not yet
 *   defined. (not implemented).
